# FIFO_SV
FIFO (First-In First-Out) Design in SystemVerilog This repository contains a synchronous FIFO buffer implemented in SystemVerilog. FIFO follows the First-In First-Out principle, where the earliest written data is read first. The design supports reset, write/read operations, and status flags like full and empty.
